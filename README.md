# Hello there, my name is Sergio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer focused on implementing solutions related to content management.

I have worked for leading companies in their sectors, initially in the area of digitalisation and process automation tools (Kofax, KTA, ReadSoft, SAP IM). I am currently developing products for all areas of homeland security (.Net, C#, WPF).

I love it and I make my own slogan "Never stop learning".
