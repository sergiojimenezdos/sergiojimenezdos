# Hello world, my name is Sergio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer focused on implementing solutions related to content management.

I have worked for leading companies in their sectors, initially in the area of digitalisation and process automation tools (technologies *Kofax, KTA, ReadSoft, SAP IM*). I am currently developing products for several areas of homeland security (technologies *.Net, C#, WPF*).

:mortar_board: I love it and I make my own slogan "Never stop learning".  

ðŸŒ± In addition to my professional career, I'm interested in learning how to develop mobile applications, especially with Flutter. **Here we go!**
